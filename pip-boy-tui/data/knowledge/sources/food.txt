### Universal Edibility Test

When unsure if a plant is safe to eat, use this systematic test. Only test ONE plant part at a time (leaf, stem, root, etc.).

1. Separate the plant into parts: leaves, stems, roots, buds, flowers.
2. Smell the part — reject anything that smells of almonds or peach (possible cyanide).
3. Rub a small piece on your inner wrist. Wait 15 minutes. If irritation occurs, reject.
4. Touch a small piece to the corner of your mouth. Wait 15 minutes.
5. Touch to your tongue. Wait 15 minutes.
6. Chew a small piece, hold in mouth for 15 minutes. Spit out.
7. If no ill effects, swallow a small amount. Wait 8 hours.
8. If no ill effects, eat a larger portion. Wait another 8 hours.
9. If still no ill effects, the plant part is likely safe to eat.

NEVER eat: mushrooms unless 100% positively identified. Do not use this test on mushrooms — some deadly mushrooms taste pleasant and symptoms appear days later.

### Safe Common Wild Edibles (Temperate Regions)

Dandelion: entire plant is edible. Leaves raw in salad or cooked (young leaves are less bitter). Roots can be roasted as coffee substitute. Flowers are edible.

Nettles (stinging nettle): cook to neutralise stings. Rich in iron and vitamins. Boil or steam for 5 minutes. Young spring leaves are best. Makes excellent soup.

Chickweed: small white-flowered ground cover. Mild flavour, eat raw or cooked. High in vitamins C and A.

Clover (red and white): flowers and leaves are edible. Flowers are sweet. Dried flower heads can be ground into flour.

Plantain (broadleaf): leaves are edible raw when young, or cooked when older. Seeds can be collected and ground.

Blackberries/raspberries: obvious wild fruit. Leaves make a pleasant tea.

Rose hips: the fruit of wild roses. Extremely high in vitamin C (20x more than oranges). Eat raw, make tea, or dry for storage. Remove seeds and hairs from inside.

Acorns: from oak trees. Contain tannins that must be leached out. Shell, crush, and soak in multiple changes of water (or run water over them) until bitterness is gone. Then dry and grind into flour.

Hawthorn: berries are edible raw or cooked. Leaves and flowers make tea. Berries can be made into jelly.

Elder: flowers can be eaten or made into cordial. Berries MUST be cooked (raw elderberries cause nausea). Cook into jam, wine, or syrup. Do not eat leaves, bark, or stems — they contain cyanide.

### Poisonous Plants to Avoid

Foxglove (Digitalis): purple bell-shaped flowers. All parts are lethal — contains cardiac glycosides.
Hemlock (Conium): looks similar to wild carrot/parsley but has purple-blotched stems and a musty smell. Extremely toxic.
Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna): shiny black berries, all parts toxic.
Yew: red berries with a single seed. The seed and all green parts are lethal. The red berry flesh is technically not toxic but not worth the risk.
Lords-and-ladies (Arum maculatum): bright red berries, hooded flowers. All parts toxic.
Giant hogweed: causes severe burns on skin contact when exposed to sunlight. Do not touch.

### Trapping and Hunting

Snares: a loop of wire or strong cordage set on an animal trail. The animal walks through, the loop tightens around its neck or body. Set snares at ground level on rabbit runs (look for worn paths through undergrowth, droppings, fur on fences). Use 20-gauge brass wire or strong paracord. Set multiple snares — one in ten may produce a catch.

Deadfall trap: a heavy rock or log propped up by a trigger mechanism. When an animal takes the bait, the support collapses and the weight falls. Figure-4 trigger is the classic design: three sticks notched to interlock, with bait on the horizontal arm.

Fishing: improvise hooks from thorns, bones, safety pins, or bent wire. Use insects, worms, berries, or small pieces of bright cloth as bait. In still water, fish feed near shores at dawn and dusk. In streams, fish rest behind rocks facing upstream.

### Food Preservation

Drying/dehydrating: slice meat thinly, hang in sun or near a smoky fire. Jerky keeps for weeks. Dry fruit and herbs the same way.

Smoking: hot smoking cooks and preserves. Build a smoky fire (use green or damp wood for smoke) in a confined space with the food hung above. Smoke for 12-24 hours.

Salt curing: pack meat in salt. Salt draws out moisture and inhibits bacterial growth. Requires a lot of salt.

Fermentation: lacto-fermentation preserves vegetables. Pack shredded cabbage (or other vegetables) with 2% salt by weight into a jar, press down to submerge in its own liquid, cover, and leave at room temperature for 1-4 weeks. Creates sauerkraut — high in vitamins and probiotics.

Root cellaring: store root vegetables (potatoes, carrots, turnips) in a cool, dark, humid place (underground). They keep for months.

### Cooking Without Pots

Hot rock cooking: heat rocks in a fire, then use them to boil water in a wooden bowl, animal skin, or bark container. Drop hot rocks in with wooden tongs, replace as they cool.

Spit roasting: skewer meat on a green (living) wood stick over coals.

Clay baking: wrap food (fish, roots, meat) in wet clay and place in hot coals. The clay hardens and steams the food inside. Peel off the clay when done.

Earth oven (hangi/imu): dig a pit, build a fire in it, heat rocks, rake out coals, place food wrapped in leaves on the rocks, cover with earth. Slow-cooks large quantities over several hours.
