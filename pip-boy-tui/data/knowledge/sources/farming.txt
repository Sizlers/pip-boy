## DOMAIN: Farming, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry

### Soil Basics

Healthy soil has: organic matter (5%+), good drainage, earthworms, a dark colour, and a crumbly texture. Clay soil holds water but drains poorly. Sandy soil drains fast but doesn't hold nutrients. Loam (mix of clay, sand, silt) is ideal.

Test soil pH with vinegar (fizzes = alkaline) and baking soda (fizzes = acidic). Most vegetables prefer pH 6.0-7.0. Add lime to raise pH, sulphur or pine needles to lower it.

### Composting

Mix "greens" (nitrogen-rich: food scraps, fresh grass, manure) with "browns" (carbon-rich: dry leaves, straw, cardboard) at roughly 1:3 ratio by volume. Turn the pile every 1-2 weeks. Keep moist but not wet. A well-managed compost pile reaches 55-65°C (hot enough to kill weed seeds and pathogens). Ready in 2-6 months — finished compost is dark, crumbly, and smells earthy.

### Crop Rotation

Never plant the same family in the same bed two years in a row. Rotate in this order:
Year 1: Legumes (beans, peas) — fix nitrogen in soil.
Year 2: Brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, kale) — heavy feeders, use the nitrogen.
Year 3: Roots (carrots, potatoes, onions) — break up soil.
Year 4: Fruiting crops (tomatoes, squash, peppers) — light feeders.
Then back to legumes. This prevents disease buildup and maintains soil fertility.

### Companion Planting

Tomatoes + basil: basil repels aphids and whitefly. Also improves tomato flavour (anecdotal).
Carrots + onions: onion smell deters carrot fly, carrot smell deters onion fly.
Beans + sweetcorn + squash (Three Sisters): beans fix nitrogen, corn provides a climbing pole, squash shades the ground suppressing weeds.
Marigolds: plant throughout the garden — they repel nematodes and many insect pests.
Nasturtiums: act as a "trap crop" — aphids prefer them, keeping them off your vegetables.

Do NOT plant: tomatoes near potatoes (share blight), fennel near most vegetables (inhibits growth), beans near onions/garlic.

### Seed Saving

Open-pollinated varieties produce true-to-type seeds. Hybrid (F1) seeds do not — their offspring are unpredictable. For civilisation rebuilding, focus on heirloom/open-pollinated varieties.

Let the strongest, healthiest plants go to seed. Tomato seeds: scoop out seeds with pulp, ferment in water for 3 days (removes germination inhibitor), rinse, dry on paper. Bean/pea seeds: leave pods on the plant until they dry and rattle. Store all seeds in a cool, dry, dark place. Properly stored seeds remain viable for 2-10 years depending on species.

### Basic Animal Husbandry

Chickens: easiest livestock to start with. Provide eggs (1 per hen per day in peak season), meat, manure, and pest control. Need a secure coop (predator-proof), fresh water, feed (grain, scraps, bugs), grit for digestion, and calcium (crushed oyster shell) for strong eggshells. A rooster is needed for fertile eggs (breeding), not for egg production.

Goats: hardy, browse on weeds and scrub. Provide milk (dairy goats produce 2-4L/day), meat, and fibre (from certain breeds). Need fencing (goats escape everything), shelter, fresh water, and supplemental feed in winter.

Bees: provide honey (40-60 lbs per hive per year in good conditions), beeswax, and critical pollination services. A Langstroth hive is standard. Bees need a water source and diverse flowering plants within 5km.

### Preserving the Harvest

Canning: requires glass jars, lids, and a large pot for water bath (high-acid foods) or pressure canner (low-acid foods). Properly canned food lasts 1-5 years.

Drying: herbs, fruits, and vegetables can be sun-dried or dehydrator-dried. Store in airtight containers.

Fermentation: sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles. Uses salt and natural lactobacillus bacteria. No special equipment needed.

Root cellar: underground or earth-sheltered storage space maintaining 0-5°C and high humidity. Stores potatoes, carrots, beets, apples, cabbage for months.

### Growing Calendar (Temperate Zone 7-8)

March-April: sow peas, broad beans, lettuce, spinach, radishes outdoors. Start tomatoes, peppers, squash indoors.
May: plant out tomatoes, peppers after last frost. Direct sow beans, sweetcorn, courgettes.
June-July: harvest early crops, succession sow lettuce and beans.
August-September: sow overwintering crops (garlic, onion sets, winter lettuce, spring cabbage).
October-November: harvest root crops, clear beds, add compost, plant green manures (field beans, clover).
