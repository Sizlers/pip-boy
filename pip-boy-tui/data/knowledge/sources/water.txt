## DOMAIN: Water Procurement and Purification

### Finding Water

In temperate climates, water collects in valleys, depressions, and at the base of hills. Follow animal tracks downhill — they often lead to water sources. Birds flying in a straight line at dawn or dusk are usually heading to water. Bees are never more than 5 km from water. Green vegetation in an otherwise dry area indicates underground water.

Dig in dry riverbeds at the outside of bends — water collects there even when the surface is dry. Dig to about 1 metre. In coastal areas, dig above the high tide line — freshwater floats on salt water.

Morning dew can be collected by tying absorbent cloth around your ankles and walking through grass before sunrise. Wring into a container. You can collect 500ml–1L per hour this way.

Rainwater is generally safe to drink without treatment if collected directly.

### Solar Still

Dig a hole approximately 1 metre wide and 60cm deep. Place a container in the centre. Cover the hole with a clear plastic sheet, seal the edges with soil or rocks. Place a small stone in the centre of the sheet so it dips toward the container. Sunlight heats the ground, moisture evaporates and condenses on the underside of the plastic, drips into the container. Yields 500ml–1L per day depending on soil moisture and sunlight. Add non-poisonous green vegetation to the hole to increase output.

### Transpiration Bag

Tie a clear plastic bag around a leafy branch of a non-poisonous tree. Sunlight causes the leaves to transpire — moisture collects in the bottom of the bag. Yields 200–500ml per day per bag. Best with broadleaf trees. Set up multiple bags.

### Boiling

Boiling is the most reliable purification method. Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute. At elevations above 2000m, boil for 3 minutes due to the lower boiling point. Boiling kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Does not remove chemical contaminants.

### Chemical Treatment

Household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite): add 2 drops per litre of clear water, 4 drops for cloudy water. Stir and wait 30 minutes before drinking.

Iodine tablets: follow manufacturer's instructions. Typically 1 tablet per litre, wait 30 minutes. Do not use long-term — excess iodine affects thyroid function. Not recommended for pregnant women.

### Filtration

In an emergency, filter through layers: gravel, then sand, then charcoal (from a fire, crushed). This removes particulates and some bacteria but does NOT make water safe alone — still boil after filtering.

Charcoal adsorbs some chemicals and improves taste. Activated charcoal is best but regular wood charcoal works in emergencies.

SODIS (Solar Disinfection): fill clear PET plastic bottles with water, place in direct sunlight for 6 hours (or 2 days in cloudy conditions). UV radiation kills pathogens. Bottles must be <2L for effective UV penetration.

### Water Storage

Store purified water in clean, sealed containers away from sunlight. Rotate every 6 months. Add 2 drops of bleach per litre for long-term storage.

A healthy adult needs 2–3 litres of water per day in temperate conditions. In hot conditions or during heavy physical activity, this rises to 4–6 litres. Dehydration symptoms: dark urine, headache, dizziness, dry mouth.

### Signs of Contaminated Water

Avoid water that has: a foul smell, oily film on the surface, green algae bloom, dead animals nearby, or is downstream from industrial or agricultural areas. Stagnant water is higher risk than flowing water.
