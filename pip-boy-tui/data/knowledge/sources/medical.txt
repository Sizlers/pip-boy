## DOMAIN: Medical and First Aid

### IMPORTANT: Seek professional medical help whenever possible. This information is for emergency situations only.

### Primary Assessment (DR ABC)

D — Danger: ensure the scene is safe for you and the casualty.
R — Response: tap shoulders, shout "Are you okay?" Check for consciousness.
A — Airway: tilt head back, lift chin to open airway. Check for obstructions.
B — Breathing: look, listen, feel for 10 seconds. If not breathing, begin CPR.
C — Circulation: check for severe bleeding. Apply direct pressure to stop major haemorrhage.

### CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)

For adults: 30 chest compressions at 100-120 per minute, 5-6cm deep, centre of chest. Then 2 rescue breaths. Repeat. Push hard and fast. If unwilling or unable to give breaths, compression-only CPR is still effective. Continue until help arrives or the person recovers.

For children (1-puberty): same ratio, 30:2, but use one hand for compressions, 5cm deep.
For infants (<1 year): 30:2 ratio, two fingers for compressions, 4cm deep. Cover mouth AND nose for breaths.

### Bleeding Control

Direct pressure: press firmly with a clean cloth, do not remove the cloth even if blood soaks through — add more layers. Elevate the limb above the heart if possible.

Tourniquet: for life-threatening limb bleeding that direct pressure cannot control. Apply 5-7cm above the wound (never on a joint). Tighten until bleeding stops. Note the time applied. A tourniquet should be a last resort — it can cause tissue damage if left on too long, but it saves lives. An improvised tourniquet: use a strip of fabric at least 4cm wide with a windlass (stick to twist and tighten). Never use wire, string, or narrow materials.

### Wound Care

Clean the wound with clean water — flush thoroughly to remove debris. If available, use dilute iodine or saline. Apply antibiotic ointment if available. Cover with a clean dressing and bandage. Change dressings daily. Watch for signs of infection: increasing redness, warmth, swelling, pus, red streaks from the wound, fever.

### Burns

Cool immediately with clean running water for 20 minutes. Do not use ice, butter, or toothpaste. Do not burst blisters — they protect the underlying skin. Cover with cling film or a clean non-fluffy dressing. Severe burns (larger than the casualty's palm, or on face/hands/genitals/joints) need professional care.

First degree: red, painful, no blisters (sunburn). Will heal on its own.
Second degree: blisters, very painful, red/white mottled skin. Risk of infection.
Third degree: white/charred, may be painless (nerve damage). Always needs medical care.

### Fractures

Signs: pain, swelling, deformity, inability to use the limb, grating sensation, bruising.

Immobilise the fracture: splint the limb in the position found. Use sticks, rolled newspaper, or any rigid material padded with cloth. Secure above and below the fracture site. Check circulation below the splint (pulse, colour, sensation) regularly.

Open fracture (bone through skin): do not push bone back in. Cover with a clean moist dressing, splint, and get to medical help urgently. High risk of infection.

### Dislocations

Do not attempt to relocate a dislocated joint unless trained. Immobilise in the position found. Apply ice if available to reduce swelling. A dislocated shoulder can sometimes be self-reduced using the Cunningham technique (massaging specific muscle groups) but this requires training.

### Hypothermia

Symptoms progress: shivering, confusion, slurred speech, drowsiness, loss of shivering (severe), unconsciousness.

Treatment: get to shelter, remove wet clothing, insulate from the ground, wrap in blankets/sleeping bags, provide warm sweet drinks if conscious. Skin-to-skin contact in a sleeping bag is effective. Do NOT rub extremities, apply direct heat to skin, or give alcohol. Rewarm gradually — rapid rewarming can cause cardiac arrest in severe cases.

### Heat Illness

Heat exhaustion: heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, headache, dizziness. Move to shade, cool with water, give fluids with electrolytes.

Heat stroke: body temperature above 40°C, confusion, hot dry skin (sweating may stop), seizures. This is a medical emergency. Cool aggressively: immerse in cold water, apply ice to neck/armpits/groin. Call for help immediately.

### Dehydration

Signs: dark urine, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, low urine output. Treat by drinking water with electrolytes. Oral rehydration solution: 1 litre water + 6 teaspoons sugar + half teaspoon salt.

### Choking

Adult: encourage coughing. If unable to cough: 5 back blows between shoulder blades, then 5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre). Alternate until obstruction clears.

### Anaphylaxis

Severe allergic reaction: swelling of face/throat, difficulty breathing, rash, drop in blood pressure. Use an EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) if available — inject into outer thigh. Call for emergency help. Place casualty on their back with legs elevated (unless breathing difficulty, then sit them up).

### Natural Remedies (Emergency Use)

Honey: antibacterial properties, can be applied to wounds. Also effective for coughs.
Yarrow: crushed leaves applied to wounds help stop bleeding (traditional poultice).
Plantain (the weed, not the banana): chewed leaf applied as a poultice for insect stings and minor wounds.
Willow bark: contains salicin (aspirin precursor). Chew or make tea for pain relief and fever reduction.
Garlic: has antibacterial properties. Crushed and applied to wounds or eaten raw for respiratory infections.
Charcoal: activated charcoal can be used for poisoning (adsorbs toxins in the stomach). Do NOT use for corrosive substances.
