## DOMAIN: Shelter and Protection

### Priorities

The survival rule of threes: you can survive 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter in extreme conditions, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. Shelter is often your most urgent need — hypothermia kills faster than dehydration or starvation.

### Site Selection

Choose a site that is: protected from wind, not in a flood plain or dry riverbed, away from dead trees (widowmakers), near water but not in a depression (cold air pools), on slightly elevated ground, near building materials. Avoid hilltops (wind exposure), valley floors (cold air sinks), and areas under lone tall trees (lightning risk).

### Debris Hut

The most important emergency shelter in temperate forests. Lay a ridgepole (3m long, sturdy branch) from the ground to a support (tree fork, rock) at about waist height. Lean branches against the ridgepole at 45° on both sides. Layer leaves, pine needles, bracken, or grass over the frame — minimum 60cm thick (the thicker the better). The shelter should be just big enough to fit inside — smaller spaces retain body heat. Fill the interior floor with dry leaves for insulation from the ground. A properly built debris hut can keep you warm in near-freezing conditions without a fire.

### Lean-To

Quick to build, good for moderate conditions. Lash a horizontal pole between two trees at about 1.5m height. Lean branches against it at 45° on one side. Cover with leaves, bark, or a tarp. Build your fire on the open side — the lean-to reflects heat back. Less insulated than a debris hut but allows fire use.

### Tarp Shelter Configurations

If you have a tarp or plastic sheet: A-frame (ridge line between two trees, tarp draped over), lean-to (one edge high, opposite staked low), or diamond (hung from centre point, corners staked out for 360° rain protection). Use 550 paracord or natural cordage. Always angle away from prevailing wind.

### Snow Shelters

Quinzhee: pile snow into a mound 2m high, let it sinter (harden) for 2-3 hours, then hollow out from one side. Wall thickness 30-40cm. Poke a ventilation hole near the top. Interior stays around 0°C even when outside is much colder. Body heat warms the small space.

Snow trench: dig a trench in deep snow, lay branches or a tarp across the top, cover with snow. Quick and effective.

### Insulation from the Ground

The ground steals body heat via conduction faster than air via convection. Always insulate between you and the ground. Use: dry leaves (30cm thick minimum), pine boughs, grass bundles, bark, a sleeping pad, or even a pile of small branches. This is more important than insulation above you.

### Cooling Shelter (Hot Climates)

In desert or tropical heat: dig a shallow trench and cover with a raised shade structure (tarp, branches with leaves). Air circulates through the gap. The ground below surface level is cooler. Minimise physical activity during the hottest hours (10am-4pm). Rest in shade.

### Improvised Cordage

Natural cordage from: inner bark of dead trees (lime, willow, elm), long grasses twisted together, nettle stems (dried and processed), cattail leaves, or roots split lengthwise. Reverse-wrap technique: take two strands, twist each clockwise, then wrap them around each other counter-clockwise. Test strength before relying on it for shelter construction.
