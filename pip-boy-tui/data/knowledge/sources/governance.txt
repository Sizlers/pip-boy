## DOMAIN: Governance, Law, and Social Organisation

### Why Governance Matters for Rebuilding

After a collapse, the greatest threat is often not nature but other humans. Establishing fair governance early prevents warlordism, hoarding, and conflict. History shows that groups with agreed-upon rules and dispute resolution survive better than those without.

### Foundational Principles

Rule of law: laws apply equally to everyone, including leaders. No one is above the law.
Consent of the governed: authority derives from the people it serves. Leaders serve at the community's will.
Separation of powers: those who make rules, enforce rules, and judge disputes should be different people/groups. Concentration of all three in one person is tyranny.
Due process: no punishment without a fair hearing. The accused has the right to know the charges, present a defence, and be judged by impartial people.
Property rights: people must be secure in their possessions and the fruits of their labour, or they will not produce.

### The Magna Carta (1215) — Key Principles

The Magna Carta established that even kings are subject to law. Key ideas still relevant:
- No free person shall be imprisoned, dispossessed, or destroyed except by lawful judgement of their peers or the law of the land. (Clause 39)
- Justice shall not be sold, denied, or delayed. (Clause 40)
- Taxes/levies require common consent. (Clause 12)
- Standardised weights and measures for fair trade. (Clause 35)

### Common Law Basics

Common law developed in England over centuries. Core principles:
- Precedent: past decisions guide future ones. Consistency and predictability.
- Jury trial: judgement by ordinary community members, not just a single authority.
- Innocent until proven guilty: the burden of proof is on the accuser.
- Proportional punishment: the punishment should fit the crime.
- Right to self-defence: you may use reasonable force to protect yourself and others from imminent harm.
- Freedom of contract: people can make voluntary agreements that are binding.

### Practical Small Community Governance

For a post-collapse community of 20-200 people:

Council: elected representatives (one per ~20 people). Term limits (e.g., 1 year). Rotating leadership prevents power consolidation.

Community charter: a written document (constitution equivalent) that establishes:
- Rights: speech, property, fair trial, movement, association.
- Duties: contributing labour, militia/defence duty, following community decisions.
- Decision process: majority vote for ordinary matters, supermajority (2/3) for charter changes.
- Dispute resolution: mediation first, then arbitration by council.
- Expulsion: only for the most serious offences, by supermajority vote, after a hearing.

Resource management: common resources (water source, grazing land, forest) need explicit rules to prevent tragedy of the commons. Assign quotas, rotation schedules, or designate a steward.

### Trade and Currency

Barter works for small groups but becomes inefficient as communities grow. Historical solutions:
- Commodity money: a universally useful item becomes currency (salt, tobacco, ammunition, grain). Must be divisible, durable, portable, and have intrinsic value.
- Representative money: tokens (tally sticks, paper notes) that represent a claim on stored commodities.
- Key principle: the money supply should roughly match the goods available, or you get inflation (too much money) or deflation (too little).

Standardised weights and measures are critical for fair trade. Establish them early and enforce them.

### Record Keeping

Written records are civilisation's memory. Establish record-keeping for:
- Land boundaries and ownership
- Births, deaths, marriages
- Agreements and contracts
- Council decisions and laws
- Crop yields and resource inventories
- Technical knowledge (preserve this Pip-Boy's knowledge base in written form!)

### Conflict Resolution

Escalation ladder:
1. Direct conversation between parties.
2. Mediation: a neutral third party helps them find agreement.
3. Arbitration: a neutral third party hears both sides and makes a binding decision.
4. Council hearing: for serious matters affecting the community.
5. Exile/separation: absolute last resort for irreconcilable dangerous individuals.

Violence as a resolution method should be explicitly prohibited by the community charter. Self-defence remains a right.

### Defence and Security

Organise a community militia: every able-bodied adult trains and takes shifts on watch. Establish a perimeter, communication signals, and a plan for various threats. Stockpile defensible positions. Intelligence: maintain awareness of other groups in the region — trade where possible, prepare for conflict where necessary.
